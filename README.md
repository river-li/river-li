### About me üëè

![](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=river-li&label=profile%20views&color=green&style=flat)

Here is River(Zichuan) Li, I'm a first year Ph.D. in Indiana University Bloomington, major in Computer Science.

In general, my research area is Computer System/Software Security.

More Specifically, I am fascinated by novel attack techniques that could bypass security defenses and gain privileges.

And I am planning to learn Program Analysis, Formal Methods and Machine Learning techniques to solve security problems.

When I'm free, I enjoy [reading](https://book.douban.com/people/176314301/), watching [movies](https://movie.douban.com/people/176314301/) and [animations](https://bangumi.tv/user/573381).
