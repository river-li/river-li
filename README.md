### About me 👏

Here is River(Zichuan) Li, I'm now a Master Student in Wuhan University, major in Cyberspace Security. And I will join Indiana University Bloomington as a Ph.D. student in Computer Science.

In general, my research area is Computer System/Software Security.

More Specifically, I am fascinated by novel attack techniques that could bypass security defenses and gain privileges.

And I am planning to learn Program Analysis, Formal Methods and Machine Learning techniques to solve security problems.

When I'm free, I enjoy [reading](https://book.douban.com/people/176314301/), watching [movies](https://movie.douban.com/people/176314301/) and [animations](https://bangumi.tv/user/573381).

I also lead team [10TG](https://github.com/10TG) (alias for IoT Group) in WHU, where I participated many security competitions and I am fortunate to work with all my team members.
